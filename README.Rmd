## What is corporaexplorer?

**corporaexplorer** is an R package that uses the `Shiny` graphical user interface framework for dynamic exploration of text collections.

**corporaexplorer** is designed for use with a wide range of text collections; one example could be a collection of tens of thousands of documents scraped from a governmental website; another example could be the collected works of a novelist; a third example could be the chapters of a single book.

**corporaexplorer**'s intended primary audience are qualitatively oriented researchers who
rely on close reading of textual documents as part of their academic activity,
but the package should also be a useful supplement for those doing quantitative textual research and wishing to visit the texts under study.
Finally, by offering a convenient way to explore any character vector, it can also be useful for a wide range of other R users.

While collecting and preparing the text collections to be explored requires some familiarity with R programming, using the Shiny apps for exploring and extracting documents from the corpus should be fairly intuitive also for those with no programming knowledge, once the apps have been set up by a collaborator. Thus, the aim is for the package to be useful for anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of R -- or with collaborators who have such knowledge.


## Installation

To install the released version from CRAN,
simply run the following from an R console:

``` r
install.packages("corporaexplorer")
```

Alternatively,
to install the development version from GitHub,
run the following from an R console:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kgjerde/corporaexplorer")
```

**corporaexplorer** works on Mac OS, Windows and Linux.
(The Shiny apps look much clunkier on Windows than on the other platforms,
but the apps are fully functional.)

*Note to developers:
The package's internal test suite uses the [`shinytest`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest) package,
which requires that [`PhantomJS`](http://phantomjs.org/) is installed.
This can be done through the `shinytest::installDependencies()` function.*

## A note on platforms and encoding

**corporaexplorer** works on Mac OS, Windows and Linux,
and there are some important differences in how R handles text
on the different platforms.
If you are working with plain English text,
there will most likely be no issues with encoding on any platform.
Unfortunately, working with
non-[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) encoded text in R
(e.g. non-English characters), *can* be complicated -- in particular on Windows. 

**On Mac OS or Linux**, problems with encoding will likely not arise at all.
If problems do arise, they can typically be solved by
making the R "locale" unicode-friendly (e.g. `Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL", "en_US.UTF-8")`).
NB! This assumes that the text is UTF-8 encoded,
so if changing the locale in this way does not help,
make sure that the text is encoded as UTF-8 characters.
Alternatively, if you can ascertain the character encoding, set the locale correspondingly.

**On Windows**, things can be much more complicated.
The most important thing is to check carefully that
the texts appear as expected in `corporaexplorer`'s apps,
and that the searches function as expected.
If there are problems, a good place to start is a
blog post with the telling title
["Escaping from character encoding hell in R on Windows"](https://dss.iq.harvard.edu/blog/escaping-character-encoding-hell-r-windows).
